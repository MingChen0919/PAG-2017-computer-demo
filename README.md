### Advanced search

* *Fuzzy search*: When you don't know how to exactly spell your keywords, you use `fuzzy` search. `fuzzy` search allows you to search for similar words. You use the `~` at the end of your keyword for `fuzzy` search (`keyword~`). Examples:

  + `sequence` -> `sequeeence~`
  + `Alnus rhombifolia` -> `alnus  rhmobifla~`
